= Fedora ELN deliverables

WARNING: Fedora ELN is a development environment. It is not intended for production use.


== Compose

The latest production compose of Fedora ELN packages is available at https://odcs.fedoraproject.org/composes/production/latest-Fedora-ELN/

A mirror of this compose is also available at http://mirror.facebook.net/fedora-eln/production/latest-Fedora-ELN/

See also xref:compose.adoc[Compose].

== Container image

As a part of the compose, we build also container images which are then published to Quay.io image registry under the name `quay.io/fedoraci/fedora:eln-x86_64`.

To run Fedora ELN container use:

```
$ podman run -it quay.io/fedoraci/fedora:eln-x86_64
```

== Mock environment

To build custom packages for ELN you can setup Mock environment as described at xref:buildroot.adoc[Buildroot].
